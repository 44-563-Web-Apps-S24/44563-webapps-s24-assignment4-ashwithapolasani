    <h1>Ashwitha Reddy Polasani Does to chekov Tonight</h1>
    <h6>THE ANNIVERSARY by Anton Chekov</h6>

    <h4>MERCHUTKINA.</h4> <p>[Surprised] And where's the money?</p>
<br>
<h4>KHIRIN.</h4> <p>You haven't a head, but this [Taps the table and then points to
his forehead.]</p>
<br>
<h4>MERCHUTKINA.</h4><p>[Offended] What? Well, never mind, never mind.... You can
do that to your own wife, but I'm the wife of a civil servant.... You
can't do that to me!</p>
<br>
<h4>CKHIRIN.</h4><p>[Losing his temper] Get out of this!
MERCHUTKINA. No, no, no... none of that!</p>
<br>
<h4>KHIRIN.</h4><p>If you don't get out this second, I'll call for the hall-porter!
Get out! [Stamping.]</p>
<br>
<h4>MERCHUTKINA.</h4><p> ever mind, never mind! I'm not afraid! I've seen the like
of you before! Miser!</p>
<br>
<h4>KHIRIN.</h4><p>I don't think I've ever seen a more awful woman in my life....
Ouf! It's given me a headache.... [Breathing heavily] I tell you once
more... do you hear me? If you don't get out of this, you old devil,
I'll grind you into powder! I've got such a character that I'm perfectly
capable of laming you for life! I can commit a crime!</p>
<br>
<h4>MERCHUTKINA.</h4><p> I've heard barking dogs before. I'm not afraid. I've seen
the like of you before.</p>
<br>

<h4>KHIRIN.</h4><p>[In despair] I can't stand it! I'm ill! I can't! [Sits down at
his desk] They've let the Bank get filled with women, and I can't finish
my report! I can't.</p>
<br>
<h4>MERCHUTKINA.</h4><p>I don't want anybody else's money, but my own, according to
law. You ought to be ashamed of yourself! Sitting in a government office
in felt boots....</p>
<br>

[Enter SHIPUCHIN and TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA.]

<h4>TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA.</h4><p>[Following her husband] We spent the evening at the
Berezhnitskys. Katya was wearing a sky-blue frock of foulard silk, cut
low at the neck.... She looks very well with her hair done over her
head, and I did her hair myself.... She was perfectly fascinating....</p>
<br>
<h4>SHIPUCHIN.</h4><p>[Who has had enough of it already] Yes, yes...
fascinating.... They may be here any moment....</p>
<br>
<h4>MERCHUTKINA.</h4><p>Your excellency!</p>
<br>
<h4>SHIPUCHIN.</h4><p>[Dully] What else? What do you want?</p>
<br>
<h4>MERCHUTKINA. Your excellency! [Points to KHIRIN] This man... this man
tapped the table with his finger, and then his head.... You told him to
look after my affair, but he insults me and says all sorts of things.
I'm a weak, defenceless woman....</h4>
